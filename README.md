# UX (USER-EXPERIENCE)
The target audience is both broad and narrow at the same time. From 8 to 80. 
The only requirement is an interest in birds. 

Maybe a more niche hobby in the past I think the lockdowns of recent years have given a broader range of people an interest in nature and in particular birdlife and the their songs. The dawn chorus never seemed louder than during those early extreme lockdowns, without so many cars on the road and planes in the sky. A much needed bright spot during grim times. 

Even experienced birdwatchers can struggle to recognise the individual calls and they can seem baffling to newcomers. But a little knowledge of birdsong can really add to the experience of birdwatching or enhance a walk to the woods or park.
